## 📜 Project Description
The **Vote-to-Earn Contract** is a **blockchain-powered governance system** that transforms traditional voting by incentivizing participation with token rewards. This system is designed to enhance decentralized decision-making, ensuring fairness, transparency, and security through on-chain verification. By participating in governance proposals, users not only have their voices heard but also earn valuable tokens, reinforcing active engagement in decentralized ecosystems.
